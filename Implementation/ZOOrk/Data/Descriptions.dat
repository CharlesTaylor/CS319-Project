You are in a vast field of green. A rather soft breeze blows at your direction, carrying with it a wicked scent of sulfur. It must be coming from close by.
You are standing near a lake. The water seems way too still to be sanitary.
You are in a forest. There are trees in every direction around you. The chirping of birds can be heard loud and clear.
You are near a canyon. The view is breathtaking.
You are in a swamp. If you go any further in this direction you are sure to be sucked into an abyss of gooey nightmare.

You've reached an old village. Nobody seems to inhabit it anymore. It was perhaps the village where the young warriors were brought up to fight the evil of the underworld. Seems as if part of the village was destroyed during an enemy attack. There are, however, several cottages still intact.
