CS319-Project
=============

CS319 Project of Group-1 in Section 1
Our project, which will consist of an object-oriented approach to text-based computer games;
it will be similar to the classic game Zork.
The player will start the game in a random location with random attributes and items on the map 
and will have to type in specific commands to interact with the environment in a seemingly endless map, 
which will also be randomly generated.
The objective of the game will be for the player to survive by gathering items and tools as according to his/her needs.
